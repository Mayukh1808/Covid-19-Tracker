## Covid-19 Tracker

This project was built for anyone to track Covid-19 cases.

It is a simple React project which fetches fresh data from a [free API](https://covid19.mathdro.id/api) and displays that in the frontend.

This was a practice project. But feel free to suggest any changes or directly contribute by raising a Pull Request.
